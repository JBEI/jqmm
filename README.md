# JBEI Quantitative Metabolic Modeling (jQMM) Library

The jQMM library is an open-source, python-based library for bioengineering. The jQMM library provides tools for modeling internal metabolic fluxes and leveraging other 'omics data for metabolic engineering for the production of biofuels and other purposes. It is intended to facilitate the design and metabolic engineering of organisms for biofuels and other chemicals, as well as investigations of cellular metabolism and â€™omics data leveraging.  As an open source software project, JBEI hopes it will attract additions from the community and grow with the rapidly changing field of metabolic flux analysis.

Specifically, the jQMM library provides tools for the following capabilities:

* The jQMM is a complete toolbox for performing types of flux analysis that are typically disjoint: Flux Balance Analysis and 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis.
* The jQMM can use 13C labeling experimental data to constrain comprehensive genome-scale models through a technique called two-scale 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis (2S-13C MFA).
* The jQMM demonstrates a method that uses proteomics data to produce actionable items that increase biofuel production.

All code is illustrated in a variety of Jupyter notebook demos (see /jupyterNotebooks folder) that enhance reproducibility and provide the capability to be modified by the user. A paper explaining the different capabilities is now in review, and a link to it will be posted as soon as it is published.

Code can be found in the /code folder whereas data used for the demonstratiosn can be found in the /data folder.

This library requires GAMS (https://www.gams.com/) and CONOPT (http://www.conopt.com/) licenses to work. Jupyter notebooks have been created with GAMS Release: 24.5.4 r54492 LEX-LEG x86 64bit/Linux and CONOPT version 3.17A .

## Getting Started

Clone this github repository and test the library by running the jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/). Run first the "Quick tests" in notebook A0, and then choose tests from the other jupyter notebooks as desired.  

We also provide a Docker version of this library which automates the installation, including all required software prerequsites. To use the Docker version, first download and install Docker from https://www.docker.com, and then follow the jQMM docker instructions here: https://hub.docker.com/r/mhgarci1/jqmm/
